# Lightweight-2D-to-3D-Reconstruction-and-Skinning-Pipeline
 A Pipeline that converts 2D pose images into fully rigged 3D meshes. A lightweight 2Dâ†’3D reconstruction model (Pixel2Mesh-inspired with a MobileNet-style backbone and attention-augmented GCN) followed by a Hyperspectral Inverse Skinning module that recovers per-vertex skinning weights, rigid transforms, and a generated bone structure.
